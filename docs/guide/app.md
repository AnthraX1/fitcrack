Navigating the App
==================

Webadmin is a web application and you can use it on any device with a web browser that has access to your server. This means that the app will look different on various form factors, for example a phone.

After logging in, you will see a permanent app bar up at the top and a navigation menu on the left. These are always available regardless of current context.

> Note that the navigation may be hidden on narrower screens. To toggle it, use the hamburger menu icon on the far left of the app bar or swipe from the left edge on a touch screen.


App Bar and Notifications
-------------------------

The app bar is always at the top and gives you access to the navigation, if it is hidden. On the right side, there is a button to open the notification drawer and a sign out button.

The notification drawer shows all of the notifications you received about job statuses and more. They are shown from newest to oldest.
